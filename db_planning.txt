So, we'll need a place to keep track of the "Pledges"

Then, when the netting is calculated we'll make dumps to the "Donations" 
and the "PoliticalContributions" tables. 

Apart from that, each one of these will be connected to Users

Then we'll probably have one for the charities and candidates as well

users:
  - user_id
  - name
  - dob
  - stripe information needed?
  - authentication info needed?

Pledge:
  - user_id
  - amount
  - candidate 
  - charity
  - race (not needed yet, but eventually)
  - timestamp

Donations:
  - user_id
  - charity_id
  - amount
  - date

Contributions: 
  - user_id
  - candidate_id
  - race_id (again, probably not necessary yet)
  - amount
  - date

Candidates:
  - candidate name
  - political party
  - race_id
  - stripe information?

Charities: 
  - charity name
  - stripe information?
